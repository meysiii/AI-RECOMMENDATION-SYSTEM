# 👋 Introduction

 The project focuses on understanding the fundamental concepts behind recommendation systems and how they are used to personalize user experiences in real-world applications.

This project helped me gain practical knowledge of AI-driven personalization, collaborative filtering logic, and data-based decision-making using Java.

# 📄 Project Description

The AI-Based Recommendation System is designed to suggest products or content to users based on their preferences and past interactions. The system uses a collaborative filtering approach, where recommendations are generated by analyzing the behavior and ratings of multiple users.

Instead of relying on predefined rules, the system compares user preferences, identifies similarities between users, and recommends items that the target user has not interacted with but may find relevant. This approach simulates how real-world platforms like e-commerce websites and streaming services generate personalized recommendations.

The project uses sample user-item rating data and processes it using core Java logic to produce meaningful recommendations. It demonstrates the foundational working of recommendation engines without using complex machine learning frameworks, making it simple, understandable, and beginner-friendly.

# ✨ Features

User-based collaborative filtering recommendation logic

Suggests items not previously rated by the user

Uses sample user–item rating data

Simple and beginner-friendly Java implementation

Console-based output for easy understanding

Fully offline (no APIs or external services required)

# 🔧 Tech Stack

Java – Core programming and recommendation logic

Java Collections Framework – HashMap, ArrayList, Map

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

# 🚀 How It Works

User-item rating data is stored using Java collections

The system selects a target user

Ratings of other users are analyzed

Items not rated by the target user are identified

Recommendation scores are calculated based on other users’ ratings

The most relevant items are suggested to the user
